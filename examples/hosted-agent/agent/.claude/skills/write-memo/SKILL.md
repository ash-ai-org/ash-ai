# Write Memo

When the user asks for a memo or report on a topic:

1. Check memory (mcp__memory__search_nodes) for any previously stored facts on this topic
2. If needed, use WebSearch and the fetch MCP tool to gather fresh information
3. Write a structured memo

## Output Format

---
**MEMO**

**To:** [user or "Team"]
**From:** Research Assistant
**Date:** [today's date]
**Re:** [topic]

---

**Executive Summary**
[2-3 sentence overview]

**Background**
[context and why this matters]

**Findings**
[numbered list of key findings with supporting evidence]

**Recommendations**
[actionable next steps]

**Open Questions**
[things that need further investigation]

---

## Guidelines

- Keep the memo to one page equivalent (~500 words) unless the user asks for more detail
- Lead with the conclusion — busy readers read the executive summary first
- Use data and citations to support claims
- Store the memo's key conclusions in memory for future reference
